# File Sorting System:

## Description:

A file sorting system which can sort your files in your folder into different folders.
This program automatically creates folders and changes the files location based on the extension of the file.

There are two options as of now:

- Basic Sort: Sorts your folder on a single level into 6 folders namely {Photos, AudioVideo, Documents, CodingFiles, Folders, Others}.
- Deep Sort: Further sorts your documents folders based on their extensions.

#### This program is still under development. New versions will also include a custom sorting feature using which the user can create a custom sort based on their desired extensions, filenames and foldernames.
